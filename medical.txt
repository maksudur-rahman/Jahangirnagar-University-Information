Jahangirnagar University has its own medical center for students, teachers and other staff member. The center provides 
24-hour service and is supervised by the chief medical officers with a staff of qualified doctors. Despite bearing all 
expenses related to treatment for students, it only provides health-related advice to staff members (including teachers).
Jahangirnagar University maintains a medical center established in mid 1972. The center used to be located in Al Beruni.
 It was moved to its present location (beside the Fazilatunnesa hall and behind the transformation office) later on. 
Presently, 30 medicine companies supply their products . A new medical centre building is being built following a long 
student movement.
