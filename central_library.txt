Established in 1985, the JU library is equipped with a huge collection of books. Located behind a monument of
 "Sangshaptak", the library is conveniently placed between the main academic buildings and the dormitories. 
The entire area has Wi-Fi coverage. There are more than 110,000 books, 14,000 hard bound journals, and 22,000 online
 journals in the library. The library can accommodate over 170 students at a time. There is a cyber center in the 
premises. Airy with ample glass openings, the library is an elegant piece of architecture.

Obtaining and cancelling a library membership involves a fair number of steps. The library administration plans to 
extend the library buildings and make the whole system computerized, to make it easier to lend books. The library's 
design used to be more spacious than it currently is. But the authority did not complete its entire structure. This
 results in students facing problems when using the library, especially since the university is residential.
